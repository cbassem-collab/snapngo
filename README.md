## Snap N Go 
#### by the Summer 2023 Lab (Sofia Kobayashi & Helen Mao)

- `all_connected/` directory is where all the final components and their backend driver (`connections.py`) are stored.
- `old_work/` is where we put previous students' work to reference and to make sure none of it got overwritten.
- `cat_bot` holds our Summer '23 test bot named catBot. Sometimes, it sends cat pics to the Slack. It also has some notes on how to:
  1. Send messages from the Bot -> Slack (prompted by running the `cat_bot.py` file
  2. Connect to a web server to listen for user messages & send back automatic responses
